# c-journal
A simple terminal program that stores journal entries and prints them.

I made this in a few days because I wanted to experiment more with strings and files. In this program you can move between an unlimited amount of pages of entires. There is also a search feature for looking up pages if you have a lot of them. You can create entries but not remove them (I still am thinking about adding that). Idk it was fun to mess around with. Not the greatest program and something may break.
